# OMDENA-SCHOOL
Here will be found all My assignments done when doing my Advanced Data Science, Machine Learning and Data engineering course from Omdena.

At the of the course, I made my final project named: **"Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machines using IoT Data."**

Here is a description of the final project:

**Project Overview:**

The project aims to develop a system that uses machine learning to predict when an industrial machine is likely to fail, using real-time data captured through IoT sensors. This predictive maintenance system will help companies save on repair costs and downtime by addressing potential issues before they lead to machine failures.

**Final Product:**

The final product is a predictive maintenance system that:

- Continuously receives and processes data from IoT sensors installed on industrial machines.
- Applies trained machine learning models to predict potential failures and maintenance needs.
- Provides a user-friendly dashboard that displays predictions, machine health, and alerts for maintenance teams.
